# Welcome to CasinoGames!
- This will be a place to enjoy a text-based version of your favorite games at the casino.
- Please check back in perodically to see our new updates

## Current games
### roulette.js, roulette-multi.js
- You know you love the thrill of the spin and the bounce... (okay that's not in this version) but the fun is still there!
- roulette.js lets you give it a spin, one click at a time.
- roulette-multi.js lets you customize your number of spins using the "totalSpins" const. It will then provide a readout of the following spins along with their respective frequency of occurrence. 

### craps.js
- Give it a roll!
- bet[betType, betAmount]
- current betTypes: "pass" & "dont"
- you must update balance after each roll (working on this)
