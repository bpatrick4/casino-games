### roulette.js, roulette-one.js
- You know you love the thrill of the spin and the bounce... (okay that's not in this version) but the fun is still there!
- roulette-one.js lets you give it a spin, one click at a time.
- roulette.js lets you customize your number of spins using the "totalSpins" const. It will then provide a readout of the following spins along with their respective frequency of occurrence. 

### craps.js
- Give it a roll!
- running the code returns a log to console of:
die one: x
die two: y
roll total: x + y


## Progress
